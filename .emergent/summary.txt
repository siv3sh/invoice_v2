The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned an initial MVP of an invoice and project management application into a more robust and feature-rich system. The trajectory highlights an iterative development process driven by user feedback, often focused on critical bug fixes related to data integrity, PDF generation, and UI rendering. Key achievements include implementing core BOQ upload, project/invoice management, and partial billing. Significant challenges involved persistent frontend rendering issues (e.g., missing table columns, session management) and complex PDF formatting (currency symbols, layout, branding). The AI engineer demonstrated a systematic debugging approach, using backend and frontend testing, and continuously refining the codebase to meet evolving requirements and fix critical display issues. The work progressed from initial scaffolding and feature implementation to detailed refinement and complex business logic implementation, such as GST rules and PDF layout.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively engaged in a major feature expansion and critical PDF/UI fixes based on user feedback. The work involved:

1.  **Addressing PDF Display and UI Alignment Issues**: The user reported that PDFs were displaying as raw code and that the download/print buttons were not visible or were poorly aligned. The engineer moved the buttons directly into the AMOUNT column to ensure visibility and performed extensive fixes on backend PDF generation (headers, content type, currency symbols, text wrapping, company color Hexa#127285) and frontend PDF handling (using  API). UI elements were also refined, leading to a new, clean left sidebar navigation.
2.  **Implementing Critical Business Logic (GST, Excel)**: Overhauled the GST system to include standard Indian rates (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) and auto-detection for IGST vs. CGST+SGST based on client state. Improved Excel BOQ parsing to correctly extract Unit/UOM and auto-generate Serial Numbers. Implemented proper calculation and display of Basic, GST, and Grand Totals.
3.  **Enhancing Project Management**: Started implementing the user's request for a detailed project view. This included adding advance received to project creation, and planning to show number of bills generated, value according to R1, R2, etc., and balance value within each project.
4.  **Adding New Core Features**: The engineer recently added backend endpoints and frontend components for Item Master, Smart Filters/Search, Reports/Insights, and a User Management system for super admins. The Bank Guarantee section was also just initiated, with endpoints added.

The very last action taken was to update the invoice creation to handle proforma tax options and payment terms, signifying the ongoing work on the comprehensive enhancements requested by the user.
